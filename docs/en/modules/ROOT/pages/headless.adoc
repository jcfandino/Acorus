Acorus offers a few features that aren't directly related to user interface.
Occasionally, an application running in a headless context
wants to utilize these features.


== TestHeadless

{url-examples}/TestHeadless.java[TestHeadless]
is an example of a headless application that extends `ActionApplication`.

[NOTE]
====
`TestHeadless` can't be run from the app chooser.

== Summary

* Acorus can also be useful in headless contexts.
