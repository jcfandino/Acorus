A _combo_ represents a combination of hotkeys.
More precisely, it consists of a hotkey
plus a set of positive and/or negative signals.

* To define a combo with a single positive signal,
  invoke `new Combo(code, signalName, true)`
* To bind a combo to an action,
  invoke `inputMode.bind(actionName, combo)`


== HelloCombo

{url-tutorial}/HelloCombo.java[HelloCombo] is an example application
that binds 2 signals and 6 combos.

Acorus help nodes display combo bindings
alongside the simple hotkey bindings, if any.
For example:

* "shift+y" means pressing kbd:[y] while the "shift" signal is active.
* "noshift+y" means pressing kbd:[y] while "shift" is inactive.


== Summary

* A combo represents a combination of hotkeys, such as "ctrl+c".
* Combos can be bound to actions, much like simple hotkeys can.
